## Step by step data analysis. How are rental bikes used?

#### This analysis was done by @DataWorkshop Katowice where I have the honor to play the role of mentor.

<p align="justify">
<b>The goal of the project:</b> inspect how the rentals bikes in our city are used, how often and for how long are they rented,
where users generally go from and to. The data was downloaded from <b>https://otwartedane.medialabkatowice.eu/</b>

You will here find the info how to:
- load the 2018 rental data and check basic info (p.ex. the shape of dataframe)
- check the average weekly/monthly rental's number
- check the average/median time for bikes' rentals
- check the number of free bikes' rentals (under 15 minutes)
- check if there is a difference between working days, weekends and holidays
- check the number and time of rentals for hour intervals
- check the id of most popular bike (rented the most)
- check most popular routes (departure-return)
- show basic plots
- show the average weekly/monthly rental's number
- show the average time for bikes' rentals
- load the 2018 stations data and check basic info (p.ex. the shape of dataframe)
- check the number of stations available in 2018
- show the stations and their capacity on a map
- find most rented bike and check if it visited all possible stations
